      <h1>Govt to Impose 40% Tariff on Used Cars</h1>
      <p>By Business Desk | Published Aug 26, 2025 | 9:49 am</p>
      <p>
        The government has announced that accidental and low-quality used cars
        will not be allowed into Pakistan, while a hefty 40% tariff will be
        imposed on commercial imports of used vehicles starting next month, a
        move officials say is aimed at protecting the local auto industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        The decision, however, means consumers will not see any immediate relief
        in car prices from the upcoming trade liberalisation, as local
        assemblers maintain that high government taxation, ranging from 30% to
        as much as 61% of the retail price, already keeps vehicles expensive in
        Pakistan. The policy announcement was made on Monday during a joint
        meeting of the Senate Standing Committees on Finance and Industry. Joint
        Secretary for Trade Policy Mohammad Ashfaq told lawmakers that the
        government, under commitments made with the International Monetary Fund
        (IMF), will enforce additional tariff protection equivalent to 40% of
        the price of new cars.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ashfaq said the government has yet to decide whether to continue with
        existing import schemes, such as transfer of residence, baggage, and
        gift, once commercial imports are formally allowed. At present,
        commercial imports are banned, and nearly one-fourth of market demand is
        met through vehicles brought in under these schemes, often mildly
        accidental but preferred by consumers over locally produced options. As
        part of its $7 billion IMF bailout, Pakistan has agreed to gradually
        open the auto sector to imports. From September, commercial imports of
        used vehicles up to five years old will be permitted, with all age and
        quality restrictions slated to be lifted by July next year.

        Over the next four years, the additional 40% tariff will be reduced to
        zero, paving the way for imports of six- to eight-year-old vehicles.
        Standards, however, will be introduced to minimise environmental risks,
        officials said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pakistan is also obligated under the IMF programme to slash its overall
        tariff regime from the current average of 20.2% to 9.7% within five
        years, a 52% reduction. In the first year (FY26), the average tariff
        will fall to 15.7%, a 22.3% cut in protection. This will be achieved by
        reducing customs duty to 11.2%, additional customs duty to 1.8%, and
        regulatory duty to 2.7%.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additional customs duties are to be phased out in four years, regulatory
        duties in five, and exemptions eliminated within the same timeframe. The
        tariff structure will be simplified to just four slabs, with a maximum
        rate of 15%.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA) and the
        Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts and Accessories Manufacturers
        (PAAPAM) have launched a lobbying effort against the IMF-driven policy
        changes. Both groups have made representations to the Senate committee,
        warning that liberalization could undermine local industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, auto sector products fall under the Auto Policy with customs
        duties as high as 35%. These protections will begin to phase out on July
        1, 2026.
      </p>
      <p>
        Analysts say the policy reflects Islamabad’s balancing act between IMF
        conditionalities and pressures from the local auto lobby, leaving
        consumers caught in the middle. For now, the import ban on accidental
        cars and the new 40% tariff mean vehicle prices are unlikely to come
        down anytime soon.
